# ParseQueue

The parse queue is a component in the Ruby Compiler Toolkit Project (RCTP). Its
role is to facilitate the movement of language tokens from one compiler phase
(like the lexical analyzer) to the next one (like the parser). More than just a
simple queue, it supports backing up or falling back to earlier states allowing
the parser to try other paths in the syntax tree when one path runs into a
dead end.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'parse_queue'
